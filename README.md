# GOLFML

## Why another GOLFML repository.

I've created this repository as it looks like the original GOLFML has been abandoned. My goal is to take the original golfml spec and
convert it into json data. The reason for this is json has become the prefered data interchange format that is being used on the web. 

json format makes for easier data exchange via api.
