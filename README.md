# GOLFML-JSON

## Why another GOLFML repository.

This repo was designed to be a complete re-write of the original GOLFML specification. The intent is to change the format over to JSON data-interchange format. JSON has become more and more popular around the web and having the GOLFML spec converted over to JSON will make intergration of its data accross different web apps much easier.
